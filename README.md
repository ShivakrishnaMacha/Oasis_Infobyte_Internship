# Shivakrishna Macha's Data Science Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository. Here, you will find a collection of my data science projects developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte and other personal projects. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing my majors in Data Analytics and Visualization at Yeshiva University, where I have developed a strong foundation in data science and analytics. My recent internship at Oasis Infobyte provided me with hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of real-world data problems.

## Internship at Oasis Infobyte

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I had the opportunity to work on various data analytics projects. This internship was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. I focused on developing skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning. Below are some of the projects I worked on:

### 1. Iris Flower Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their petal and sepal dimensions. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, and the model is implemented using Python and scikit-learn.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing and visualization using pandas and matplotlib.
- Model training and evaluation using various classification algorithms.
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying the iris species.

### 2. Sales Prediction

In this project, I developed a predictive model to forecast sales based on historical sales data. This project demonstrates my ability to handle time series data and implement regression models.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Implemented linear regression and decision tree regression models.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE.

### 3. Unemployment Analysis

This project aims to analyze unemployment data and identify trends and patterns. The analysis helps in understanding the factors affecting unemployment rates and provides insights for policy-making.

**Key Highlights:**
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization using seaborn.
- Time series analysis to identify trends and seasonality.
- Interpretation of results to provide actionable insights.
